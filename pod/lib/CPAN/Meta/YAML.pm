# ABSTRACT: Read and write a subset of YAML for CPAN Meta files

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module implements a subset of the YAML specification for use in reading
and writing CPAN metadata files like F<META.yml> and F<MYMETA.yml>.  It should
not be used for any other general YAML parsing or generation task.

=head1 SUPPORT

This module is currently derived from L<YAML::Tiny> by Adam Kennedy.  If
there are bugs in how it parses a particular META.yml file, please file
a bug report in the YAML::Tiny bugtracker:
